  In a subsequence, the elements need to follow the order of the original array
  whereas in a subset there is no constraint on the order of the elements. 
   Arr = 1, 16, 7, 8, 4
   subsequence = 1, 16, 8
   subset = 1, 8, 16 doesn't follow any order it can LIS or can't be LIS
 
A divisible subset is the one in which if we pick two elements i and j from the subset, 
then either arr[i]%arr[j] == 0 or arr[j]%arr[i] == 0 For example, [16,8,4] is a divisible subset.
