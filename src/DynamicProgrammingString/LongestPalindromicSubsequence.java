 same as longest common subsequence, only you have to made 2nd string after reversing 1st string
 then logic is same as we did in longest subsequence
 
 Input: s = "bbbb"
Output: 4
Explanation: One possible longest palindromic subsequence is "bbbb".

Ans: s1 = "abc" and S2 = "cba"(reverse) and apply subsequence logic
